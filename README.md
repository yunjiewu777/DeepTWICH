## Introduction

Welcome to Clus-Vis! This is an interactive visualization system that allows machine learning and healthcare professionals to build a better healthcare index.

- We retrieved geo-tagged tweets using keywords and built a pipeline consisting of data preprocessing, keyword and embedding extractions, and clustering to depict the neighborhood environment in terms of healthcare resources to predicted outcomes of heart failure patients
- This interactive visualization system allows machine learning and health professionals to customize the entire pipeline and iteratively refine clustering by imposing pair-wise soft constraints on keywords 
- An abstract of the preceding research is published at [American Heart Association’s annual Scientific Sessions 2022](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/circ.146.suppl_1.15011)
- This research is targetted at IEEE VIS’23; the current version of the abstract is shown below

### Abstract (2022.12.6)

Healthcare indices are used to evaluate the overall accessibility of public health resources for a given region and have been found to be especially useful for predicting post-treatment outcomes for a variety of diseases. Heart failure (HF) patients' outcome after receiving treatment, for instance, has been discovered to be strongly correlated with the patient’s residing neighborhood, a variable yet to be incorporated into the process of health indices' generation. This paper introduces a new healthcare index that is proven more effective than the current state-of-the-art through the utilization of novel metrics (i.e., census-level Twitter data) to account for neighborhood impact. Importantly, we contribute a visual analytic system that enables the construction and refinement of this new index. Specifically, the system allows machine learning experts, healthcare professionals, and policymakers to (1) preprocess the tweets retrieved by specified keywords, e.g., eliminating URLs, stemming words, etc., and (2) customize, inspect, and refine a topic model of relevant words via keyword extraction and interactive clustering. Ultimately, this system allows for the iterative refinement of a more environment-reflective healthcare index, whose performance is compared to the SDI (Social Deprivation Index), the traditional census-based metric. We also illustrate the efficacy of the system through a series of usage scenarios.
